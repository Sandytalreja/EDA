## Project Overview
In this project, I used **web scraping** to extract GDP data from a website, clean the data, convert GDP values from **Million USD** to **Billion USD**, and round the values to two decimal places. The project demonstrates the use of Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical operations.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of GDP values for various countries, extracted from a webpage using the `pandas.read_html()` method. After extraction, the data is processed, cleaned, and converted for further analysis.
